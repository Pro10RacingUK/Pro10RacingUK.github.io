<p>A simple set of rules to bring together 1/10 pan cars enthusiasts, who want
to experience the speed the cars are capable of, how great they look on the
track, keeping it simple.</p>

<p>Miss the days of the fast, wide Pro10? Already have a 200mm pan car? Bought
one of those long-wheelbase Speedpassion or VBC Le Mans Prototype cars? Got 2S
ESC and batteries lying around? Got 1S electronics and batteries, but dislike
having to set up boost? Or you like boosted? <strong>No problem, join the
racing!</strong></p>
